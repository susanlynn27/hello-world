# hello-world
my hello-world on github
# I am a long-ago Developer but I've been a Tech Biz Analyst for 25+ years.
# I have loads of SQL experience, but no "newer" technologies.
# I have read about Cloud and AI, and began to pursue the Data-Scientist career-path
# but my current job ended prematurely, and now I need to find a new one FAST.
# I guess it will have to be in what I know, rather than what I might like to learn.
# This edit is reason for changes here.
